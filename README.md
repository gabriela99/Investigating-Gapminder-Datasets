# Investigating-Gapminder-Datasets

Gapminder is an organization that has provided a collection of everyday items in households throughout various income groups and across cultures. The team at Gapminder has also collected a large amount of information "about how people live their lives in different countries, tracked across the years, and on a number of different indicators"(Udacity description).

For the purposes of this project, I investigated a few datasets in order to understand general trends within our global community. These datasets are GDP per capita, the mean life expectancy at birth, and the mean education level of a nation for both women and men between the ages of 15 and 24.
