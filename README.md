# Investigating-Gapminder-Datasets

[Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) is an organization that has provided a collection of everyday items in households throughout various income groups and across cultures. In order to better understand some off their data, I investigated a few datasets to understand general trends within our global community. These datasets are GDP per capita, the mean life expectancy at birth, and the mean education level of a nation for both women and men between the ages of 15 and 24. The data is analysed in a Jupyter notebook.


## Installation of Jupyter notebook
You can find the installation documentation for the
[Jupyter platform, on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
The documentation for advanced usage of Jupyter notebook can be found
[here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

For a local installation, make sure you have
[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run:

    $ pip install notebook

## Usage - Running Jupyter notebook

### Running in a local installation

Launch with:

    $ jupyter notebook

### Running in a remote installation

You need some configuration before starting Jupyter notebook remotely. See [Running a notebook server](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html).
